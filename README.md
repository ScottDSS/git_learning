# Introduction 

This is a basic HelloWorld app programme

*Assuming you already have Python istalled*

###To Start

- Open your terminal and type `python` *this will put you in interactive mode*
- Type `print ("Hello World")` *press enter*
- Type `exit ()` *this will bring you out of interactive mode and take you back to your terminal*

If you would like to play around in python and create more than one Hello World app I advise you to create a folder.

*Follow these steps*

- To create a new folder type `mkdir <e.g python_learning>` *press enter*
- This is where you can save all your python examples.
