# Introduction 

This is a basic Hello World app programme. A "Hello World!" programme generally is a computer programme that outputs or displays the message "Hello World!" It is often the first programme that those learning to code write.

Python already comes pre-installed on Mac OS X

## To Start

- Open your terminal and type `python` *this will put you in interactive mode*
- Type `print ("Hello World")` *press enter*
- Type `exit ()` *this will bring you out of interactive mode and take you back to your terminal*

If you would like to play around in python and create more than one Hello World app I advise you to create a folder.

*Follow these steps*

- To create a new folder type `mkdir <e.g python_learning>` *press enter*
- To save your Python example you must `.py` e.g `<01_hello_world.py>`
- This is where you can save all your python examples.

*Now you have had time to play around with python and hopefully created your own *Hello World* app. Its now time to create a Hello World app and push it to your own GitHub repository.*

First step you need to complete is:

Create your own GitHub account. 
* [GitHub.com](github.com) 

Next step is to create your own repository:
